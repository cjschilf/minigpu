# Mini GPU 

Designing the smallest GPU I can manage to learn about how they work. Goal of getting a subset of RISC V plus the vector extension working under a SIMD processing framework.

## Directories
- **src/**: Verilog source files for the GPU
- **tb/**: Testbenches for various modules
- **docs/**: Documentation for arch, ISA, design

## Getting Started
This will be added after all the actual GPU parts
